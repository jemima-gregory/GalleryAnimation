# Optical Illusion Gallery Animation in OpenGL

OpenGL program which generates gallery scene displaying a variety of animated optical illusions.
The scene is a gallery room containing a mix of animated and static optical illusion art pieces. The animated illusions are an Ames Window, a ‘scanimation’ of a spinning cube, and a fish ‘teleporting’ between cones. The Ames Window is a flat object (in the z direction) which spins on its own axis 360°, from the provided AAO1 view position it appears that the window is not turning at all. The scanimation/barrier grid illusion is made of a set of lines which move across an altered background image of a cube to make it seem as though the cube is spinning. The fish vanishing animation consists of two “teleportation devices” and a fish flapping its tail and swimming. The fish appears to swim into one device and magically teleport and appear out of the other. The two static pieces are a scintillating grid illusion, which confuses the eye into seeing dots that aren’t there, and a spinning ball illusion.

Allows for the user to move around within the scene using controls.
